# Kubeadm Bootstrap

This is a set of files to bootstrap Kubeadm, which in turn is a tool to bootstrap Kubernetes.

This creates a local installation of python, ansible and terraform in order to bootstrap a 
Google Compute Platform Kubernetes installation. 

There are other ways to do this, such as running a kubeadm container, but this repo is intended
to demonstrate the setup.
